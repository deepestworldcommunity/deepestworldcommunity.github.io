# Tools


The top of the two action bars at the bottom of the screen is the tool bar. Tools can be placed here to be used.
All tools can be crafted at the workbench.

There is currently no benefit to upgrading your tools to a higher level, as they do not allow bonuses.


Currently, all tools except for the axe and piclaxe use dw.constants.INTERACT_RANGE for their range. The axe and pickaxe use dw.constants.RANGE_MELEE_BASE
