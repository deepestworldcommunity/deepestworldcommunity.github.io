# Respawn

You can choose the respawn location `dw.character.respawn`, this will be the place your character returns 
to when it dies. Also, whenever you use a portal scroll a portal will be created connecting your current 
location and this respawn location. 
After setting the respawn location you will have to wait an hour before doing so again.
