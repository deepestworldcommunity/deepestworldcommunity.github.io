# Exploration

Deepest world is made up of tiles with three coordinates: `x`, `y`, and `z`.

Exploration is a big part of the game. You can explore the world by moving around.

## Hardcoded Movement

```js
const directions = {
  north: [0, -1], 
  east: [1, 0],
  south: [0, 1],
  west: [-1, 0],
};

function moveInDirection(dir) {
  const movePoint = { x: dw.c.x, y: dw.c.y };
  movePoint.x += directions[dir][0];
  movepoint.y += directions[dir][1];
  dw.move(movePoint.x, movePoint.y);
}

const directionsToMove = ["north", "east", "north", "west", "south"]

let index = 0;
setInterval(() => {
  moveInDirection(directionsToMove[index % directionsToMove.length]);
  index++;
}, 1000);
```

## Random Exploration

Let's start with a simple exploration, the random exploration.

```js
setInterval(randomWalk, 1000)

function randomWalk() {
    let randomX = 2 * Math.random() - 1;
    let randomY = 2 * Math.random() - 1;
    dw.move(dw.character.x + randomX , dw.character.y + randomY)
}
```

`2 * Math.random() - 1` will give you a random number between -1 and 1.
This will move your character in a random direction every second.
You will explore the game world and eventually die or get stuck. But hey, you are exploring the game world! ðŸŽ‰

## Straight Walk

We can move in a straight line until we hit a wall:

```js
// Start with moving to the right
let dx = 1
let dy = 0

function straightWalk () {
  while (dw.getTerrainAt(dw.character.x + dx, dw.character.y + dy, dw.character.z) > 0) {
    dx = 2 * Math.random() - 1
    dy = 2 * Math.random() - 1
  }

  dw.move(dw.character.x + dx, dw.character.y + dy)
}

function gameLoop () {
  straightWalk()
}

setInterval(gameLoop, 1000)
```

Straight walk will keep your character moving in a straight line until it hits a wall.
Then it will move in a random direction. This will make your character explore the game world in a more structured way.

## Detecting Walls and Holes

You can access the tile you are standing on like this:

```js
dw.getTerrainAt(dw.character.x, dw.character.y, dw.character.z) // This will return the number of the tile you are standing in
dw.getTerrainAt(dw.character.x, dw.character.y, dw.character.z - 1) // This will return the terrain object of the tile below your character
```

The `z-1` is used to access the tile below you. This will return the terrain type, that you can look up in `dw.enums.Terrain`.

It's mostly used to make the game for appealing to the eye, but it is also be used for some gameplay mechanics.
Like passable terrain is always `<=0` and you can only dig on `dw.enums.Terrain.DIRT`.

Let's make a simple improvements to this script. We can check if there is a wall in front of us and if so, move in a different direction:

```js
setInterval(() => {
  if (dw.getTerrainAt(dw.character.x + 1, dw.character.y, dw.character.z) <= 0) {
    dw.move(dw.character.x + 1, dw.character.y)
  } else {
    dw.move(dw.character.x, dw.character.y + 1)
  }
}, 1000)
```

This will just check of a wall to the right and then move down (ignoring that there might be a wall there too).

## Drunken Exploration

There also is a slight variation to that called "Drunken Exploration".
It behaves like straight walk, but similar to a drunk person it fails to walk straight:

```js
// Start with moving to the right
let dx = 1
let dy = 0
// Drunkenness factor, 0 is no drunkenness = straightWalk, 1 is completely random = randomWalk
const DRUNKENNESS = 0.1

function drunkenExploration () {
  let angle = Math.atan2(dy, dx)
  angle += (Math.random() - 0.5) * DRUNKENNESS * Math.PI
  dx = Math.cos(angle)
  dy = Math.sin(angle)

  while (dw.getTerrainAt(dw.character.x + dx, dw.character.y + dy, dw.character.z) > 0) {
    dx = 2 * Math.random() - 1
    dy = 2 * Math.random() - 1
  }

  dw.move(dw.character.x + dx, dw.character.y + dy)
}

function gameLoop () {
  drunkenExploration()
}

setInterval(gameLoop, 250)
```

It's only a slight adjustment, but it might be a bit mathy, so let's break it down:

- `Math.atan2(dy, dx)` will give you the angle of the direction you are moving in.
- `(Math.random() - 0.5) * DRUNKENNESS * Math.PI` will give you a random angle between -DRUNKENNESS and DRUNKENNESS.
- `Math.cos(angle)` and `Math.sin(angle)` will give you the new direction you are moving in.

This will make your character explore the game world in a more structured way, but still with a bit of randomness.

## Visualizing the Direction

Since we humans tend to be visual people it might be better to show the current direction inside the game.
You actually can draw on the game screen:

```js
dw.on("drawOver", (ctx, cx, cy) => {
  ctx.lineWidth = 4;
  ctx.fillStyle = "red";
  ctx.beginPath();
  ctx.moveTo(dw.toCanvasX(cx), dw.toCanvasY(cy));
  ctx.lineTo(dw.toCanvasX(cx + dx), dw.toCanvasY(cy + dy));
  ctx.stroke();
});
```

This will draw a red line in the direction your character is moving in.
It's not perfect, but it will give you a rough idea of where your character is going.
If you want to learn more about what's possible with the Canvas2D API, you can check out
the [MDN Web Docs](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/CanvasRenderingContext2D).
There also is a `drawUnder` event that will draw under the character and entities.
