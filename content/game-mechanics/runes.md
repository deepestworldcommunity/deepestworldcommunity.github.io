# Runes

Runes can be placed in the skill bar to use the skills they provide.
They can all be crafted at the rune bench, but the recipes have to be learned from a rune master.
Rune Masters can be found in most settlements. They will provide quests that let you learn a new recipe.
In case you already have that recipe another item will be provided as a reward instead.
