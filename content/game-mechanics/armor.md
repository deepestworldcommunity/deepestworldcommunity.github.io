# Armor

## Armor Types

There are three primary styles of armor, this is a chance to reduce incoming damage by 50%.

### "Strength" Armor: Block

These are basic damage mitigations.

Different material tiers have different scaling in the base stats, these currently are:

* Wood
* Bronze
* Iron
* Steel

### "Dexterity" Armor: Versatility

These focus on avoiding hits and reducing mana based on distance.

Different material tiers have different scaling in the base stats, these currently are:

* Deerskin
* Sealskin

### "Intelligence" Armor: Efficiency

Focusing on a reduction in mana costs.

Different material tiers have different scaling in the base stats, these currently are:

* Linen

## Slots

There are currently ten armor slots, including the shield that is available while using one-handed weapons.

* helmet
* chest-plate
* boots
* braces
* gloves
* shield

The shield is special here: though you gain the stats of the shield, you'll lose damage at the same time. So it's not always beneficial to equip a shield.

## Accessories

Accessories are primarily a source of extra mods and do not have anything in the way of other stats.
Currently, there is no way to craft either rings, amulets or belts, which are only acquired as drops.

* amulet
* ring (2x)
* belt
