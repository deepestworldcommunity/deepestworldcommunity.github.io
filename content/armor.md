# Armor

## Armor Types

There are three primary styles of armor.

### "Strength" Armor

These are basic damage mitigations.
These are made out of wood, bronze, iron, and steel. Different tiers have different scaling in the base stats.

### "Dexterity" Armor: Versatility

These focus on avoiding hits and reducing mana based on distance.
Currently, only Tier 1 is available, made from rawhide.

### "Intelligence" Armor: Efficiency

Focusing on a reduction in mana costs.
Currently, only Tier 1 is available, made from linen.

## Slots

There are currently six armor slots, including the shield that is available while using one-handed weapons (all, except bow & crossbow).

* helmet
* chest-plate
* gloves
* boots
* belt
* shield

The shield is special here: though you gain the stats of the shield, you'll loose damage at the same time. So it's not always beneficial to equip a shield.
